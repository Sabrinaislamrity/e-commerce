# Hekto - E-commerce UI Website

**Hekto** is a fully responsive frontend e-commerce website built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It simulates a clean and modern shopping experience and includes multiple page sections like Home, Shop, Blog, and Contact. The UI is styled with Tailwind and structured with reusable components. The project is part of my portfolio showcasing modern frontend development skills.
